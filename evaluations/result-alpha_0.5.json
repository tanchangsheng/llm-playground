However, the number of housing subsidies a person has taken will affect their eligibility to apply for CPF housing grants (excluding Proximity Housing Grant). Additionally, if a person owns or has an interest in any HDB flat, they must dispose of the flat within 6 months of the completion of the flat purchase.",

This means they cannot apply for CPF housing grants, excluding the Proximity Housing Grant. However, any previous housing subsidy taken does not affect the eligibility to buy a resale flat.
